			As others saw -- I could not bring
			My passions from a common spring --
			From the same source I have not taken
			My sorrow -- I could not awaken
			My heart to joy at the same tone --
			And all I lov'd -- I lov'd alone --
			Then -- in my childhood -- in the dawn
			Of a most stormy life -- was drawn
			From ev'ry depth of good and ill
			The mystery which binds me still --
			From the torrent, or the fountain --
			From the red cliff of the mountain --
			From the sun that 'round me roll'd
			In its autumn tint of gold --
			From the lightning in the sky
			As it pass'd me flying by --
			From the thunder, and the storm --
			And the cloud that took the form
			(When the rest of Heaven was blue)
			Of a demon in my view --
